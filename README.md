# IITD INNOV8 Challenge

This is our submission to the INNOV8'24 Challenge at IIT Delhi.

We include the following files as data tables:
- personnel_behavior_info.csv
- personnel_financial_info.csv
- personnel_general_info.csv
- personnel_offences_info.csv

Our entire code is present in innov8-iitd.ipynb where we combine the files into our dataframe. This is then fed to the autoencoder from which we derive the top 50 army personnel that are most likely to defect to the Phyrgian scoundrels.
